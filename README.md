# TheScrapyOne
The Scrapy One is a small project that I started to make scraping and finding good items for CS-GO (CS2) easier and also to keep track of the progress. It still needs a lot of work to make it fully functional but for now is working and good enough for me to call it a 1.0.0 version. 

Scraping for items on Buff is not really time efficient as it requires at least a 5 sec cooldown for every page (if its is lower account will get banned, from my experience) and there is no other method to scrape without and account. So the total process will take around 30 minutes :(. 

Now here are some shortcuts as I wanted to keep the design clean: 

- **CTRL + F** : To find an item in a table 
- **CTRL + G** : To filter by profit
- **CTRL + H** : To filter by buy price

# How to use
1. Clone the repository on your system
2. Make sure `python` is installed
3. I recommend creating a new virtual enviroment `python -m venv your_venv`
4. Install required libraries `pip install -r req.txt`
5. Run `main.py` script
